# Progress Log ===========================================================

# Project has been set up
# Exploratory logs have been saved
-There are 13 variables, 6 continuous, 7 categorical, There are NA values in all of them

# NA replacement ===========================================================

## Dependents 
- replaced NA with 0

## Current.Loan.Expenses..USD 
- Has NA values. There seem to be no 0s but rather -999s. I will assume that this is a sign that the particular customer has no loan expenses

## Active.Credit.Card
-Examined what is the distribution of Loan Sanction Amount 
given different values of Active.Credit.Card var
-The Loan.Sanction.Amount..USD. for NA rows differs significantly in its mean and quartile ranges compared to the other categories (Unpossessed, Active, Inactive).
-This suggests that rows with NA might belong to a unique group with specific characteristics.
- Replaced NAs with "Unknown"

# Analyzing Variable means. Have to research if I can use it to fill in the blanks
# A better method would be to use Multiple Imputation Technique

##Income.Stability
- Mean Values do not differ significantly with the different values of Income.Stability
-Removing NAs

##Gender
-Due to the small number of NA observations (35) together with the 
lack of significant differences between the means, NAs will be deleted.

## Income..USD. 
-Judging by the histogram it appears that the var is not normally distributed- therefore cannot 
replace the missing values with the mean
- correlation shows moderate relationship with dep var
- removing all NAs together with the extreme values

## Credit.Score 
-Removed outliers and NAs

##Current.Loan.Expenses..USD
-Removed outliers and NAs

##Loan.Amount.Request..USD.
-Removed outliers and NAs

# Data discretization ===========================================================
##Age bins
checking for linearity within each bin is not the focus when you use this method. By creating bins, you are essentially assuming a constant effect of age within each bin. The regression coefficients for the dummy variables then represent the difference in the dependent variable between that bin and the reference bin. You've already established the overall non-linearity with your initial scatterplot showing the flat red line. The binning approach is a way to model this non-linearity by allowing different average effects for different age ranges.

The ANOVA test tells you if there is a statistically significant difference in the dependent variable among any of the age groups. The p-values for the individual dummy variables in the regression summary tell you if each specific group is significantly different from the reference group.

Performing a correlation analysis between the bins (categorical variables) and the ratio variables (e.g., Income..USD., Loan.Amount.Request..USD.) is not a meaningful approach because correlation analysis assumes numerical and continuous data. Binned variables like AgeGroup are categorical, so using correlation coefficients (e.g., Pearson correlation) would not yield meaningful results.
