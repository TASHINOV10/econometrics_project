# Progress Log 

# Project has been set up
# Exploratory logs have been saved
-There are 13 variables, 6 continuous, 7 categorical, There are NA values in all of them

# NA replacement

## Dependents 
- replaced NA with 0

## Current.Loan.Expenses..USD 
- Has NA values. There seem to be no 0s but rather -999s. I will assume that this is a sign that the particular customer has no loan expenses

## Active.Credit.Card
-Examined what is the distribution of Loan Sanction Amount 
given different values of Active.Credit.Card var
-The Loan.Sanction.Amount..USD. for NA rows differs significantly in its mean and quartile ranges compared to the other categories (Unpossessed, Active, Inactive).
-This suggests that rows with NA might belong to a unique group with specific characteristics.
- Replaced NAs with "Unknown"

# Analyzing Variable means. Have to research if I can use it to fill in the blanks
# A better method would be to use Multiple Imputation Technique

##Income.Stability
- Mean Values do not differ significantly with the different values of Income.Stability
-Removing NAs

##Gender
-Due to the small number of NA observations (35) together with the 
lack of significant differences between the means, NAs will be deleted.

#Remaining Variables
- Income..USD. 
- Credit.Score 
- Current.Loan.Expenses..USD

-All NAs were removed
